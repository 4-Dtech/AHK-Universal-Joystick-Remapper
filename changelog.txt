5.2 25th Nov 2013
! Axis merging has changed!
  It is now much less confusing to set up - configure each axis individually to move the slider in the direction desired.
  eg set the left pedal to move the slider left (from a resting position all the way right), right pedal to move it right.
  Then set both axes to the same virtual axis and enable merge - it should behave as expected.

5.1 21st Nov 2013
+ Added "QuickBind" function - bind game functions without leaving the game!
  Instead of manually selecting an axis or button by using the QB radio button, you can use QuickSelect.
  Bind QuickSelect to something, and when you hit it, press a button or move an axis.
  The relevant axis or button will then be selected for you.
+ "Auto Configure" function - quickly set up a straight through mapping for all buttons or axes.

5.0 20th Nov 2013
* Rewrite using my ADHD library.
! Now intended to be used when compiled to an EXE - You no longer need AutoHotkey installed.
! Old profile files are NOT COMPATIBLE.
  However, it is just the groups etc in the INI that will not work right.
  If you create a new profile, exit UJR and paste in the contents of the old profile, it may well work.
= Manual Control is gone, replaced by QuickBind
= Profile support improved
= Less tabs
= Improved hat switch support (QuickBind supports hats, whereas Manual Control did not)
= Detect Axis gone for now, it will probably return

4.3
+ Basic Hat (POV) switch support.
As AHK only supports one hat per stick, it is very basic for the moment.
It currently only supports Continuous POVs.
Currently there is no "manual control" mode for the hats

4.2
= Duplicate in profiles was always duplicating the Default profile, no matter what you had selected - fixed.
+ Added Delete Profile button

4.1
+ Duplicate profile added.

4.0
+ Profile support added.
INI file format changed, there are now two INI files - one for misc settings, one for profiles
Existing mappings are kept and moved to the default profile
Manual profile switching only for now...

3.2
+ The first physical POV Hat can now be mapped to virtual buttons. AHK only supports reading one POV :(

3.1
+ Sensitivity option for each axis.

3.0
! Please note that the format of the config file has changed, the program will back your old one up
= Fixed bug stopping button mappings not saving
= Improved UI layout, labels etc
= Major cleanup of code - now much more understandable
+ GUI position now saved in config file - when you close the app, next time you reopen it, it will be in the same place on your desktop
+ Only settings changed from their default setting are stored in the config file
+ Detect axis button! Use this to try and find out the stick ID of a physical stick.
Instructions now simplified
+ Experimental - Merging of axes
eg Merge two pedal axes into a rudder axis


2.3
+ Much improved deadzone code
  So with a 50% deadzone, if you move to 50 on an axis, it will be dead, but moving to 51 now outputs 1 rather than 51
+ Deadzone is now a text input field, so you can use any value you like
+ Input / Output slider renamed to "State"
+ Input and Output values for axes now displayed
+ Much more commented code

2.2
+ Added per-axis deadzone settings. Just 5,10,20,30,40,50,60,70 or 80 percent at the moment but I intend to allow any figure in a future version

2.1
= Fixed bug stopping UJR from working on 64-bit AHK installs.
= Fixed bug stopping mapping of virtual axis 4 or greater
+ 32 Buttons listed for physical joystick

2.0
+ Now uses Axlar's vJoy library (http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/87690-using-ahk-to-control-vjoy)
+ Now uses vJoy 2.x - Support for up to 32 buttons
You will NEED to uninstall vJoy 1.x and install 2.x to use this version

1.1
= Code for button testing no longer has one subroutine per button
= Optimised technique for inverting axes - thanks Babba on AHK forums!

1.0

= Fixed bug stopping invert working in Manual Control mode
+ Button mapping in

0.3
